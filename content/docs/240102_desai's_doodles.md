## Art + Computation
What does it mean to combine art and computation? I decided to study architecture because I was interested in the intersection of art and sciences, but after 5 years of architecture school, I still don't know how to combine my two interests effectively.

Computational design seemed like a niche for me, but is coding tools to help designers really an art form? I've spent quite some time creating and improving tools related to life-cycle analyses and environmental simulations, but more and more I feel like I'm straying away from the joy that art brings. The simple, intuitive, inexplicable feeling of happiness when touching brush to paper, when molding clay with my fingers. Numbers are beautiful, and having my code execute and estimate solar radiation is exciting, but I want to dedicate time in 2024 to use code to make art, or even more fundamentally, to understand what art is in the digital world. I hope to document my process, which will help me organize my thoughts and also share knowledge with those who are wondering similar things.

## First Steps
In the fall I discovered the [Future Sketches](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/future-sketches/overview/) group at MIT Media Lab, and was instantaneously drawn to their creative coding projects. I learned about Zach Lieberman, Golan Levin, John Maeda, and Processing, p5.js, [Design by Numbers](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/design-by-numbers-again/overview/)... 

I think the best way to learn is by doing, so I hope to start by making some creative coding projects that I am referring to as my doodles. I am going to use p5.js instead of Processing because it's web-based, and my first project will be creating a website that will serve as a sketchbook for the work to come.
